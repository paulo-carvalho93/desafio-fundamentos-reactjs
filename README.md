# React.js Fundamentals
React.js concepts challenge applied for the GoStack Bootcamp

## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, I've must continue to develop the transaction management application, GoFinances. Now I will practice what I've have learned so far in React.js along with TypeScript, using routes and sending files by form.

This will be an application that will connect to my [Challenge 06](https://github.com/paulo-carvalho93/desafio-typeorm-upload-nodejs), and display the created transactions and allow importing a CSV file to generate new records in the database.

  # Installing project dependencies

```sh
  $ There is a file example to use during the import at assets folder.

  Attention: You need the back-end running to create new transactions.
